# Data Acquisition Project: Finding YouTube Trends by Topic

## Introduction

For my data acquisition project, I wanted to explore what kinds of videos are trending on YouTube in the United States. YouTube is one of the most popular platforms for videos, and I was curious whether certain categories dominate the trending page. I also wanted to see how video engagement (views, likes, comments) differs by category.  

This project gave me a chance to learn about working with APIs, cleaning data, and doing a simple exploratory data analysis. These are all skills that are useful for real-world data projects.
