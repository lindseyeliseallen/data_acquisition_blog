# Data Acquisition Project: Finding YouTube Trends by Topic

## Introduction

For my data acquisition project, I wanted to explore what kinds of videos are trending on YouTube in the United States. YouTube is one of the most popular platforms for videos and I was curious whether certain categories dominate the trending page. I also wanted to see how video engagement (views, likes, comments) differs by category.  

This project gave me a chance to learn about working with APIs, cleaning data, and doing a simple exploratory data analysis. These are all skills that are useful for real-world data projects.  

## Motivating Question

My main question was: *Which categories of videos are trending on YouTube and how does engagement vary by category?*

To answer this, I decided to collect the most popular videos in the US using the YouTube Data API. I focused on the US to simplfy and narrow down the data, but the same method could work for other countries.
